FEARS AWAY

Overview

The primary objective of the project is to create a safer environment for people. Inspite of the gender we belong to, everyones fear of walking alone, especially in the dark. It would feel so safe and joyfull to have someone accompanying us. Taking inspiration of my personal experiences and the ones my friends shared. I am sharing the idea of finding a companion while walking the same route ,the same way we find buddies on facebook, instagram, dating sites and so many other platforms just on one click. The database will contain the details of the citizens who's identities are verified.
