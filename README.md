FEARS AWAY

Overview

The primary objective of the project is to create a safer environment for people. In spite of the gender, we belong to, everyone’s fear of walking alone, especially in the dark. It would feel so safe and joyful to have someone accompanying us. Taking inspiration of my personal experiences and the ones my friends shared. I am sharing the idea of finding a companion while walking the same route, the same way we find buddies on Facebook, Instagram, dating sites and so many other platforms just on one click. The database will contain the details of the citizens whose identities are verified. 

Features

•	Matching people taking the same routes.
•	Listing the safest routes available.
•	Listing and ranking people’s experiences based on the reviews provided by the users.
•	Listing the interests, skills, routes taken by the users.

Future Scope

•	The dataset can be used by the safety apps to enhance their services. 
•	The dataset can be used by geographically based sectors to get the data of the safest routes available.
•	Apply machine learning model for predicting the safe routes.
